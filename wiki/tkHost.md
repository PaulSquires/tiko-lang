# tkHost

Runs every tkControls widget: SDL windows, the widget tree, input, timers and fonts.

tkHost is the widget core under every tkControls control. It gives SDL the services Win32 gave a window for free: a tree of widgets in each window, hit testing, hover, mouse capture, focus and Tab order, timers, per-monitor scale, popups, modal dialogs, text input with the IME, cursors, the clipboard and file drops. It also ships the fonts tkControls draws with.

Most programs meet it only through [tkApp](tkApp): `tkWidget_SetPos` to lay out controls, `TK_WIDGET ptr` as every control's handle. Read on if you write your own widget or run without tkApp.

## Importing

```freebasic
#import "vendor/tkControls/tkHost"

using tkHost
using tkPaint
```

Every tkControls module imports tkHost publicly, so after any control's `#import`, `using tkHost` works without a line of its own. tkHost re-exports [tkPaint](tkPaint), which re-exports `vendor/SDL3/ttf` and `vendor/SDL3/image`. On Linux, put any `std/*` import before the tkControls ones.

## Example

A program without tkApp, with one widget of its own that paints a box and counts clicks:

```freebasic
dim shared as long gClicks

function Box_Proc( byval w as TK_WIDGET ptr, byval m as TK_MSG ptr ) as boolean
    select case m->msg
    case TKM_PAINT
        dim as TKRECT rc
        tkRect_Set( rc, 0, 0, w->cw, w->ch )
        m->pPaint->SetBackColor( iif( tkHost_GetFocus( w->pHost ) = w, tkRGB( 38, 79, 120 ), tkRGB( 44, 49, 58 ) ) )
        m->pPaint->PaintRect( @rc )
        dim as ustring caption = "clicks: " & gClicks
        m->pPaint->SetForeColor( tkRGB( 255, 255, 255 ) )
        m->pPaint->PaintText( caption, @rc, TK_DT_CENTER )
        return true
    case TKM_LBUTTONDOWN
        tkHost_SetFocus( w->pHost, w )      ' a widget takes the focus itself
        gClicks += 1
        tkWidget_Invalidate( w )
        return true
    case TKM_SETFOCUS, TKM_KILLFOCUS
        tkWidget_Invalidate( w )
        return true
    end select
    return false                            ' refused: keys and the wheel go on to the parent
end function

SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_VIDEO ) : TTF_Init( )
dim as TK_HOST ptr h = tkHost_Create( "tkHost", 400, 240, tkHost_FontDir() & TK_FONT_UI )
dim as TK_WIDGET ptr box = tkWidget_Create( h, 100, @Box_Proc, 0 )
box->isFocusable = true
tkWidget_SetPos( box, tkHost_Scale( h, 20 ), tkHost_Scale( h, 20 ), tkHost_Scale( h, 200 ), tkHost_Scale( h, 60 ) )
tkHost_Show( h )
tkHost_Run( h )                             ' blocks until the window closes
tkHost_Destroy( h )
TTF_Quit( ) : SDL_Quit( )
```

## Surfaces

Every OS window is a `TK_HOST`, called a surface, with its own renderer, widget tree, focus, capture and hot widget:

| Kind | Made by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TK_SURF_MAIN` | `tkHost_Create( title, w, h, defaultFont, forcedScale )` | `w`, `h` in design units: the window comes out `w * scale` pixels |
| `TK_SURF_POPUP`, `TK_SURF_TOOLTIP` | `tkHost_CreatePopup( owner, x, y, w, h, kind )` | owner window pixels (`tkHost_PlacePopup` computes them against an anchor rect). Created hidden and empty; make one per open and `tkHost_Close` it per dismissal |
| `TK_SURF_DIALOG` | `tkHost_CreateDialog( owner, title, w, h, bBorderless )` | pixels; run it with `tkHost_RunModal`, end it with `tkHost_EndModal( dlg, result )` |

A press outside a popup closes it and is consumed; Esc closes the top popup; a popup also closes when the application loses focus. A borderless dialog gets a draggable caption band with `tkHost_SetDragRect`. `tkHost_Run` blocks in the event loop until the surface quits; `tkHost_Pump` drains the queue without blocking and repaints what changed. `tkHost_Close` hides a surface at once and destroys it after the current event; `tkHost_Destroy` destroys it now, with its popups and widgets.

Fields a host program sets on a `TK_HOST`: `clrBack` (`&hAARRGGBB`), `pDefaultFont`, `pUser`, and the callbacks `OnPaint` (the surface's own background), `OnSize`, `OnScale`, `OnClosed` (a popup closed, for any reason), `OnCloseRequest` (the close button; TRUE keeps the window open), `OnPreKey` (asked before the focused widget, which is how [tkKeys](tkKeys) attaches) and `OnDrop` (a drop no widget took).

## Widgets and coordinates

A widget is a `TK_WIDGET` with a `proc` (`tkWidgetProc`) and a `pData` pointer to your own state. Make one with `tkWidget_CreateChild( parent, id, proc, pData )`, or `tkWidget_Create( host, id, proc, pData )` for a child of the surface's root (`tkHost_Root`). Children are kept in z-order: the last made is on top (`tkWidget_BringToTop` moves one).

- `x`, `y` are relative to the parent, in **device pixels**; `cw`, `ch` are its size. Messages carry **widget-local** pixels, as Win32 client coordinates did. `tkWidget_AbsRect` gives window pixels.
- Multiply design values by the scale with `tkHost_Scale( h, v )`; `TKM_SCALECHANGED` tells every widget when the window moves to a monitor with another scale, and the host re-sizes the fonts it opened.
- Flags: `isFocusable` (a Tab stop), `bWantsText` (focus here starts text input and the IME, so `TKM_CHAR` arrives), `cursor` (`TK_CURSOR_*`), `bClipChildren`.
- `tkWidget_Enable` and `tkWidget_Show` take a whole subtree out of input, Tab order, hover, capture and focus at once.
- `tkWidget_Destroy` destroys the children first, kills the widget's timers and sends `TKM_DESTROY` last: free `pData` there.

## Messages

The proc gets `TK_MSG` messages shaped like the Win32 ones they replace. Return TRUE when handled.

| Message | Carries |
| --- | --- |
| `TKM_PAINT` | `pPaint`, a [tkPaint](tkPaint) context clipped to the widget, origin at its top-left |
| `TKM_SIZE` | sent by `tkWidget_SetPos` / `SetSize` when the size changes |
| `TKM_MOUSEMOVE`, `TKM_MOUSEENTER`, `TKM_MOUSELEAVE` | `x`, `y`; enter and leave need no tracking request |
| `TKM_LBUTTONDOWN` ... `TKM_MBUTTONUP` | `x`, `y`, `clicks` (2 = a double click on the same widget) |
| `TKM_MOUSEWHEEL` | `wheelX`, `wheelY` in notches, `mods`; **bubbles** to the parent if refused |
| `TKM_KEYDOWN`, `TKM_KEYUP` | `key` (an `SDL_Keycode`), `mods`, `scancode`, `bFlag` = repeat; key down **bubbles** if refused |
| `TKM_CHAR`, `TKM_IMECOMPOSE` | `text` (UTF-8); the composition's `nStart`, `nLen` |
| `TKM_SETFOCUS`, `TKM_KILLFOCUS` | `pOther`, the widget on the other side |
| `TKM_CAPTURECHANGED` | sent at once to the widget losing the capture |
| `TKM_ENABLE`, `TKM_SHOW` | `bFlag`, the new state |
| `TKM_TIMER` | `timerId` |
| `TKM_SCALECHANGED`, `TKM_THEMECHANGED`, `TKM_DESTROY` | `fOld`, `fNew` for the scale |
| `TKM_DROPFILES`, `TKM_DROPTEXT` | `text` (paths LF-separated, `nStart` = how many), `x`, `y`; **bubble** if refused |

Rules a widget author relies on:

- **Focus is the widget's to take.** A click focuses nothing by itself: call `tkHost_SetFocus( w->pHost, w )` in `TKM_LBUTTONDOWN`. Tab and Shift+Tab walk the focusable widgets in tree order when no widget claims the key.
- **Capture** with `tkHost_SetCapture( w )` and `tkHost_ReleaseCapture( h )`: moves and the release keep coming to `w` while the mouse is outside it or the window. While a widget holds the capture it hears Esc first.
- **Timers** with `tkWidget_SetTimer( w, id, ms )`, delivered as `TKM_TIMER` on the UI thread. Ids below `TK_TIMER_APP` are reserved.
- **Theme.** On `TKM_THEMECHANGED`, re-read [tkTheme](tkTheme)'s `tkTheme_Get()` unless your widget's colours are pinned.
- **Notify like the controls do**: callbacks for user actions only; setters are silent.
- `tkHost_SetTextInputArea` tells the IME where to put its candidate window; `tkHost_SetClipboardText`, `GetClipboardText` and `HasClipboardText` reach the clipboard.

## Fonts and icons

tkControls ships its own fonts, copied beside every program that imports tkHost, so a program looks the same on every OS:

| Constant | Font |
| --- | --- |
| `TK_FONT_UI`, `TK_FONT_UI_BOLD`, `TK_FONT_UI_ITALIC` | Inter, for text |
| `TK_FONT_MONO` | Cascadia Mono, for code |
| `TK_FONT_ICONS` | Fluent UI System Icons, for glyphs |

`tkHost_FontDir()` is the folder they are in (the program's own, ending in a separator), so `tkHost_FontDir() & TK_FONT_UI` is always a file that is there. `tkHost_OpenFont( h, path, pt )` opens a font in points at the surface's scale; the surface owns it, re-sizes it when the scale changes and closes it when the surface goes. `h->pDefaultFont` is the font every control falls back to.

### Fonts from memory

A program can carry its fonts inside itself instead of beside it. Register each one's bytes under a name, and every font tkHost, [tkApp](tkApp) and [tkCodeEdit](tkCodeEdit) open takes that name where it takes a file path:

```freebasic
#embed InterRegular "fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf"

tkHost_AddFontData( "mem:Inter-Regular.ttf", @InterRegular(0), ubound( InterRegular ) + 1 )
dim as TK_HOST ptr h = tkHost_Create( "app", 400, 240, "mem:Inter-Regular.ttf" )
```

- The name must match exactly; nothing is derived from it. `mem:` plus the file name is the convention: with tkApp's `FontDir` set to `"mem:"`, its role fonts are found under their usual file names.
- The bytes stay the program's and must outlive every font opened from them. An [`#embed`](Category-Embed) array lives as long as the program.
- Registering a name again replaces it. `tkHost_HasFontData( name )` says whether a name is registered.
- `tkHost_OpenFontFace( path, pt, face )` opens face `face` of a font file or registered name, unscaled and owned by the caller. The other font opens go through it.

The `TK_ICON_*` constants are code points in `TK_FONT_ICONS` (`TK_ICON_SAVE`, `TK_ICON_FOLDER_OPEN`, `TK_ICON_SEARCH`, `TK_ICON_SETTINGS`, `TK_ICON_CLOSE` and more). Draw one with that font set: `p->PaintChar( wchr( TK_ICON_SAVE ), @rc, clr )`; controls with a glyph slot take the same string.

## Public declarations

Every public name the module declares, as the source declares it. Signatures are exact; type bodies keep their field comments and drop the rest.
