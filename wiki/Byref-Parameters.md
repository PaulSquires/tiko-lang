# Byref (Parameters)

Declaration specifier to explicitly pass a parameter by reference

## Syntax

```freebasic
ByRef param As datatype
```

## Description

Passes a variable by reference, that is its address, to a subroutine or function. When a variable is passed by reference, the contents of the variable can be changed by the target subroutine or function.

 In *[-lang qb](Compiler-Option-Lang)* and *[-lang fblite](Compiler-Option-Lang)* dialects, `ByRef` is the default parameter passing convention, unless `Option ByVal` is in effect.

 Opposite of [`ByVal`](Byval).

 **Note:** A constant or a literal expression can also be passed to such a procedure (which gets by reference), but they are obviously not modifiable from the procedure body. In that case, the compiler passes by reference a temporary variable initialized with the constant or the literal expression.

 **Note:** Arguments of STRING\*N type are copied to a temporary variable when passed to BYREF ZSTRING (or BYVAL ZSTRING PTR) parameters (since there is no expectation that STRING\*N will have it's own terminating null character) and copied back after the call.

 **Warning:** When passing by reference, it is recommended to pass an argument of the same type (or fully compatible, like a derived type for example) as that of the declared parameter. Although in some cases the compiler accepts to pass a different type, often the result is not the one expected.

## Remarks

### Usage

`[ Declare ] { Sub | Function } proc_name ( ByRef param As datatype )`

### Dialect Differences

- In *[-lang fb](Compiler-Option-Lang)* dialect, [`ByVal`](Byval) is the default parameter passing convention for all built-in types except [`String`](String) and user-defined [`Type`](Type-Udt) which are passed `ByRef` by default. The [`ZString`](Zstring) and [`WString`](Wstring) built-in types are also passed `ByRef` by default, but passing [`ByVal`](Byval) is forbidden. Arrays are always passed `ByRef` and the use of the specifier `ByRef` or [`ByVal`](Byval) is forbidden.
  In *[-lang qb](Compiler-Option-Lang)* and *[-lang fblite](Compiler-Option-Lang)* dialects, `ByRef` is the default parameter passing convention.

## Examples

```freebasic
Dim MyVar As Integer

Sub ChangeVar(ByRef AVar As Integer)

    AVar = AVar + 1

End Sub

MyVar = 1

Print "MyVar: "; MyVar 'output = 1

ChangeVar MyVar

Print "MyVar: "; MyVar 'output = 2

Sleep

End
```
