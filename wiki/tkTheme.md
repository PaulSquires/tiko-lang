# tkTheme

Keeps the shared light and dark theme every tkControls control takes its colours from.

A theme is one `TKTHEME_COLORS` struct of semantic **roles** (`Window`, `Surface`, `Text`, `Accent`, `Selected`, `Popup`, `Border`, `Error` and the rest), not a colour for each field of each control. Every control derives its own colours from the roles, so one theme switch restyles the whole program.

A theme is **applied**, not looked up at paint time. `tkTheme_Apply( t )` makes `t` the process-wide current theme and sends `TKM_THEMECHANGED` to every widget on every surface; each control then copies the roles it uses into its own colours, unless the program pinned that control's colours. Main windows and dialogs take `t.Window` as their background. Applying a theme equal to the current one does nothing. Before any theme is applied, `tkTheme_Get()` is the Dark preset, which is what every control starts with.

In a [tkApp](tkApp) program use `tkApp_SetTheme` or `tkApp_SetThemeMode` instead: they apply the theme and also fire the forms' `OnThemeChanged`, and `TKAPP_THEME_SYSTEM` follows the OS light/dark setting live.

## Importing

```freebasic
#import "vendor/tkControls/tkTheme"

using tkTheme
```

Every control and [tkApp](tkApp) import tkTheme publicly, so `using tkTheme` usually needs no `#import` of its own. It re-exports [tkHost](tkHost).

## Example

```freebasic
dim as TKTHEME_COLORS t = tkTheme_Dark()
t.Accent = tkRGB( 0, 120, 215 )
tkApp_SetTheme( t )                      ' every unpinned control and every form repaints

dim as TKBUTTON_COLORS danger = tkButton_ThemeColors( t )
danger.BackColor = tkRGB( 196, 43, 28 )
tkButton_SetColors( hDelete, @danger )   ' pins this button: the theme leaves it alone
tkButton_UnpinColors( hDelete )          ' ...until it is handed back
```

## Presets and the system setting

`tkTheme_Dark()` and `tkTheme_Light()` are the two presets. `tkTheme_SystemIsDark()` reads the OS preference through SDL (an unknown answer reads as light), and `tkTheme_System()` is the matching preset. `tkTheme_Equal( a, b )` compares two themes.

## Controls and pinning

Each control has, beside its own `SetColors`:

- `tk<X>_ThemeColors( t )`: the control's colour set derived from the roles (controls with a `TK<X>_COLORS` type);
- `tk<X>_ApplyTheme( h, t )`: applies the theme unless the colours are pinned;
- `tk<X>_UnpinColors( h )`: hands the control back to the theme and applies it at once.

Any colour setter the program calls pins the control. Item-level colours (a chart series, a toolbar item's foreground) are data, never pinned and never themed. A widget of your own follows the theme by handling `TKM_THEMECHANGED` and reading `tkTheme_Get()`.

## Coming from PsTheme

| [PsTheme](PsTheme) | tkTheme |
| --- | --- |
| `PSTHEME_COLORS` | `TKTHEME_COLORS` (the same roles, the same preset values) |
| `PsTheme_Dark`, `Light`, `System`, `SystemIsDark`, `Equal` | `tkTheme_Dark`, `Light`, `System`, `SystemIsDark`, `Equal` |
| `Ps<X>_ThemeColors`, `ApplyTheme`, `UnpinColors` | `tk<X>_ThemeColors`, `ApplyTheme`, `UnpinColors` |

- Colours are `ulong` `&hAARRGGBB` (`tkRGB`), not `COLORREF`.
- Added: the current theme itself, `tkTheme_Get` and `tkTheme_Apply`, which works without tkApp.
- Dropped: `PsTheme_ApplyTitleBar` and `ApplyCaptionOf`. SDL draws no caption, so the OS colours the title bar in its own theme.

The [PsTheme](PsTheme) page remains the behaviour reference for everything not listed here.

## Public declarations

Every public name the module declares, as the source declares it. Signatures are exact; type bodies keep their field comments and drop the rest.
