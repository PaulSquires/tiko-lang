# GDI+ procedures and types
Starts GDI+, builds colours and rectangles, and converts, saves and prints images.

<!-- scope: CGpBase -->

Starts GDI+, builds colours and rectangles, and converts, saves and prints images.

These are the plain procedures of `sys/win/gdiplus`, the `CGpBase` class every `CGp*` class
derives from, and the structures, enumerations and constants the module declares.

**Starting GDI+.** GDI+ must be running before any of its objects is created. Every `CGp*` object
takes care of this through [CGpBase](#cgpbase): the first one created starts GDI+ and the last
one destroyed shuts it down, so a program that creates its objects in each `WM_PAINT` starts and
stops GDI+ on every paint. Call [Init](#init) once at start-up and [Uninit](#uninit) at the end
to keep it running, and always do so when you call the GDI+ functions directly (`Gdip…`).
The image procedures below start and stop GDI+ for themselves.

**Colours.** A GDI+ colour is an `ARGB`, a `DWORD` holding alpha, red, green and blue from the
high byte to the low: `&hFF0000FF` is opaque blue. Alpha 255 is opaque and 0 fully transparent.
This is not the byte order of a GDI `COLORREF` (`&h00BBGGRR`); use the `GDIP_*` helpers, or the
`ARGB_*` constants of [Colours](SysWin-Colors), rather than `RGB()`.

**Status.** GDI+ reports success or failure as a `GpStatus`: `Ok` (0) on success, otherwise a
reason from the [Status table](#status-values). [StatusStr](#statusstr) turns one into text.

**Images to GDI handles.** The `…FromFile`, `…FromBuffer` and `…FromRes` procedures load a PNG,
JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP or ICO image with GDI+ and return a new GDI icon (`HICON`) or bitmap
(`HBITMAP`), optionally dimmed or turned grey, for toolbars, image lists and buttons. **You own
the handle**: free it with `DestroyIcon` or `DeleteObject`.

**The flat API.** All the GDI+ flat functions (`GdipCreateFromHDC`, `GdipDrawLine` …), and
`GdiplusStartup` and `GdiplusShutdown`, are declared too, with the opaque handle types they take
(`GpGraphics`, `GpImage`, `GpBitmap`, `GpFont` …). Every `CGp*` object keeps its handle in a
public field (`m_pGraphics`, `m_pImage`, `m_pFont` …), so you can mix the two.

## Importing

```freebasic
#import "sys/win"
#import "sys/win/gdiplus"
using win, gdiplus
```

## Example

A console program that draws a half-transparent box into a bitmap, saves it as a PNG file, reads
the file's size back and makes a grey GDI bitmap from it:

```freebasic
#import "sys/win"
#import "sys/win/gdiplus"
using win, gdiplus

function main() as long
    dim token as ULONG_PTR = gdiplus.Init()
    dim st as GpStatus
    scope
        ' a half-transparent red box on a pale background, 200 x 100 pixels
        dim bmp as CGpBitmap = CGpBitmap( 200, 100 )
        dim g as CGpGraphics = @bmp
        g.Clear( GDIP_XRGB( 240, 248, 255 ) )
        dim fill as CGpSolidBrush = CGpSolidBrush( GDIP_ARGB( 160, 255, 0, 0 ) )
        dim rc as GpRectF = GDIP_RECTF( 20, 20, 160, 60 )
        g.FillRectangle( @fill, @rc )
        st = SaveImageToPng( bmp.m_pImage, "box.png" )
        print "SaveImageToPng: "; StatusStr( st )
    end scope
    dim as DWORD w, h
    st = GetImageSizeFromFile( "box.png", @w, @h )
    print "GetImageSizeFromFile: " & rtrim( StatusStr( st ) ) & ", " & w & " x " & h
    st = GetImageSizeFromFile( "missing.png", @w, @h )
    print "missing file: "; StatusStr( st )
    ' a grey GDI bitmap made from the file
    dim hbm as HBITMAP = BitmapFromFile( "box.png", 0, true )
    if hbm then print "grey HBITMAP created" else print "BitmapFromFile failed"
    DeleteObject( hbm )
    gdiplus.Uninit( token )
    return 0
end function

end main()
```

It prints:

```text
SaveImageToPng: Ok
GetImageSizeFromFile: Ok, 200 x 100
missing file: Out of memory
grey HBITMAP created
```

GDI+ reports a file it cannot open as `OutOfMemory` (3), not as `FileNotFound`.

## Reference

### Init

```freebasic
function Init() as ULONG_PTR
```

Starts GDI+ (version 1, with its background thread) and returns the token that
[Uninit](#uninit) needs. Each call starts it once more; GDI+ stays up until every start has been
matched by a shutdown, so a program can call `Init` once at start-up whatever its objects do.

The examples write it `gdiplus.Init()`, which makes plain which module's `Init` is meant.

**Returns** the token, or 0 when GDI+ could not be started.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim token as ULONG_PTR = gdiplus.Init()
if token = 0 then print "GDI+ did not start"
gdiplus.Uninit( token )
```

Microsoft Learn: [GdiplusStartup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusinit/nf-gdiplusinit-gdiplusstartup)

### Uninit

```freebasic
sub Uninit( byval token as ULONG_PTR )
```

Shuts down the GDI+ start that `token` came from. Call it after the last `CGp*` object has been
destroyed, and never more than once per token. A token of 0 is ignored.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim token as ULONG_PTR = gdiplus.Init()
scope
    dim pen as CGpPen = CGpPen( ARGB_Red, 2 )
end scope                        ' the pen is gone before GDI+ stops
gdiplus.Uninit( token )
```

Microsoft Learn: [GdiplusShutdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusinit/nf-gdiplusinit-gdiplusshutdown)

### DllVersion

```freebasic
function DllVersion() as long
```

Returns the file version of `gdiplus.dll` times 100: major × 100 + minor, so version 10.0 gives
1000 and version 6.1 gives 601.

**Returns** the version, or 0 when it cannot be read.

**Example**

```freebasic
print "gdiplus.dll"; DllVersion()   ' 1000 on current Windows
```

Microsoft Learn: [GetFileVersionInfoW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winver/nf-winver-getfileversioninfow)

### StatusStr

```freebasic
function StatusStr( byval status as GpStatus ) as ustring
```

Returns the English description of a GDI+ status code: `"Ok"`, `"Invalid parameter"`,
`"Out of memory"`, `"File not found"` …, or `"Unknown"` for any other value.

**Returns** the description.

**Example**

```freebasic
print "[" & StatusStr( InvalidParameter ) & "]"   ' [Invalid parameter]
```

Microsoft Learn: [Status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplustypes/ne-gdiplustypes-status)

### GDIP_ARGB

```freebasic
function GDIP_ARGB( byval a as ubyte, byval r as ubyte, byval g as ubyte, byval b as ubyte ) as COLORREF
```

Returns the `ARGB` colour with alpha `a`, red `r`, green `g` and blue `b`, each 0 to 255:
`&hAARRGGBB`. The return type is `COLORREF`, a `DWORD` like `ARGB`, so it can be passed wherever
an `ARGB` is taken.

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_ARGB( 255, 255, 0, 0 ) )   ' FFFF0000: opaque red
dim glass as CGpSolidBrush = CGpSolidBrush( GDIP_ARGB( 128, 0, 0, 255 ) )
```

Microsoft Learn: [Color::MakeARGB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdipluscolor/nf-gdipluscolor-color-makeargb)

### GDIP_COLOR

```freebasic
function GDIP_COLOR( byval a as ubyte, byval r as ubyte, byval g as ubyte, byval b as ubyte ) as COLORREF
```

Another name for [GDIP_ARGB](#gdip_argb): the same arguments in the same order, the same result.

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_COLOR( 128, 1, 2, 3 ) )   ' 80010203
```

### GDIP_XRGB

```freebasic
function GDIP_XRGB( byval r as ubyte, byval g as ubyte, byval b as ubyte ) as COLORREF
```

Returns the **opaque** `ARGB` colour with red `r`, green `g` and blue `b`: alpha is 255.

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_XRGB( 1, 2, 3 ) )   ' FF010203
```

### GDIP_RGBA

```freebasic
function GDIP_RGBA( byval r as ubyte, byval g as ubyte, byval b as ubyte, byval a as ubyte ) as COLORREF
```

Returns the `ARGB` colour with red `r`, green `g`, blue `b` and alpha `a`: the arguments are in
RGBA order, the result is the usual `&hAARRGGBB`.

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_RGBA( 1, 2, 3, 4 ) )   ' 4010203
```

### GDIP_BGRA

```freebasic
function GDIP_BGRA( byval b as ubyte, byval g as ubyte, byval r as ubyte, byval a as ubyte ) as COLORREF
```

Returns the `ARGB` colour with blue `b`, green `g`, red `r` and alpha `a`: the arguments are in
the order the bytes have in memory, the result is the usual `&hAARRGGBB`.

`GDIP_BGRA` is also the name of a union that overlays a colour (`color`) with its four bytes
(`blue`, `green`, `red`, `alpha`); see [Types](#types).

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_BGRA( 1, 2, 3, 4 ) )   ' 4030201
```

### GDIP_GetAlpha, GDIP_GetRed, GDIP_GetGreen, GDIP_GetBlue

```freebasic
function GDIP_GetAlpha( byval argbcolor as COLORREF ) as byte
function GDIP_GetRed( byval argbcolor as COLORREF ) as byte
function GDIP_GetGreen( byval argbcolor as COLORREF ) as byte
function GDIP_GetBlue( byval argbcolor as COLORREF ) as byte
```

Return one component of an `ARGB` colour.

The result type is `byte`, which is **signed**: a component of 128 or more comes back negative,
so opaque alpha (255) reads as -1. Mask it with `and 255` for the value 0 to 255.

**Returns** the component, as a signed byte.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim c as ARGB = &hFF102030
print GDIP_GetAlpha( c ); GDIP_GetRed( c ); GDIP_GetGreen( c ); GDIP_GetBlue( c )   ' -1 16 32 48
print GDIP_GetAlpha( c ) and 255                                                     ' 255
```

### GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha, GDIP_ARGB_SetRed, GDIP_ARGB_SetGreen, GDIP_ARGB_SetBlue

```freebasic
function GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha( byval argbcolor as COLORREF, byval alphaColor as byte ) as ARGB
function GDIP_ARGB_SetRed( byval argbcolor as COLORREF, byval redColor as byte ) as ARGB
function GDIP_ARGB_SetGreen( byval argbcolor as COLORREF, byval greenColor as byte ) as ARGB
function GDIP_ARGB_SetBlue( byval argbcolor as COLORREF, byval blueColor as byte ) as ARGB
```

Return `argbcolor` with one component replaced and the other three unchanged. Use
`GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha` to make a translucent version of a named colour. The new component is a
`byte`, but 128 to 255 work as well: they are stored as the same bits, so
`GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha( c, 200 )` gives alpha &hC8.

**Returns** the new colour.

**Example**

```freebasic
print hex( GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha( &hFF102030, 64 ) )   ' 40102030
dim shadow as CGpSolidBrush = CGpSolidBrush( GDIP_ARGB_SetAlpha( ARGB_Black, 96 ) )
```

### GDIP_RECTF, GDIP_RECT

```freebasic
function GDIP_RECTF( byval x as single, byval y as single, byval nWidth as single, byval nHeight as single ) as GpRectF
function GDIP_RECT( byval x as long, byval y as long, byval nWidth as long, byval nHeight as long ) as GpRect
```

Return a GDI+ rectangle with its top-left corner at (`x`, `y`) and the given width and height:
`GpRectF` in `single` coordinates, `GpRect` in whole pixels. Unlike a GDI `RECT`, a GDI+
rectangle stores a width and a height, not the right and bottom edges.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim rcf as GpRectF = GDIP_RECTF( 1.5, 2, 3, 4 )
dim rc as GpRect = GDIP_RECT( 10, 10, 100, 50 )
print rcf.X; rc.Width   ' 1.5 100
```

Microsoft Learn: [RectF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-rectf)

### GDIP_POINTF, GDIP_POINT

```freebasic
function GDIP_POINTF( byval x as single, byval y as single ) as GpPointF
function GDIP_POINT( byval x as long, byval y as long ) as GpPoint
```

Return a GDI+ point (`x`, `y`): `GpPointF` in `single` coordinates, `GpPoint` in whole pixels.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim ptf as GpPointF = GDIP_POINTF( 0.5, 1.5 )
dim pt as GpPoint = GDIP_POINT( 7, 8 )
print ptf.Y; pt.X   ' 1.5 7
```

Microsoft Learn: [PointF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-pointf)

### PointsToPixels

```freebasic
function PointsToPixels( byval ptSize as single, byval fUsingWorldTransform as boolean = false ) as single
```

Converts a font size in points (1/72 inch) to pixels.

- With `fUsingWorldTransform` `false` (the default) the size is scaled with the desktop's
  horizontal DPI: `ptSize × dpi / 72`. The point size is **rounded to a whole number first**
  and the result is whole pixels, so 10.5 points gives the same as 10.
- With `true`, for a [CGpGraphics](CGpGraphics) whose world transformation already scales for
  the DPI (`ScaleTransformForDpi`), the result is `ptSize × 1.3333`, the 96-DPI conversion.

**Returns** the size in pixels.

**Example**

```freebasic
print PointsToPixels( 12 ); PointsToPixels( 10.5 ); PointsToPixels( 12, true )   ' 16 13 15.9996 at 96 DPI
```

### GetImageSizeFromFile

```freebasic
function GetImageSizeFromFile( byref wszFileName as wstring, byval nWidth as DWORD ptr, byval nHeight as DWORD ptr ) as long
```

Opens an image file with GDI+ and reads its width and height in pixels into `*nWidth` and
`*nHeight`. GDI+ is started and stopped for the call.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wszFileName` | The image file. |
| `nWidth`, `nHeight` | Receive the size; left as they were when the file cannot be opened. |

**Returns** `Ok` (0) on success; a GDI+ status on failure (`OutOfMemory` for a missing or
unreadable file); `E_INVALIDARG` for an empty file name. When GDI+ itself cannot be started it
returns 0 without filling the sizes.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim as DWORD w, h
if GetImageSizeFromFile( "photo.jpg", @w, @h ) = Ok then print w; " x"; h
```

Microsoft Learn: [Image::GetWidth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getwidth)

### ImageFromFile

```freebasic
function ImageFromFile( byref wszFileName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval imageType as long = IMAGE_ICON, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

Reads an image file into memory and converts it, like [ImageFromBuffer](#imagefrombuffer), into
a new GDI icon or bitmap of the image's size. The file is read with the Windows file functions,
so Unicode paths work; files of 4 GB or more, folders and files marked temporary are refused.

The pixels can be changed on the way:

- **`dimPercent`** from 1 to 99 moves each colour that percentage of the way towards white:
  50 turns red (255, 0, 0) into (255, 128, 128). Use it for the faded image of a disabled
  button.
- **`bGrayScale`** `true` turns each pixel grey, from 0.299 red + 0.587 green + 0.114 blue,
  after any dimming. Alpha is kept.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wszFileName` | The image file: PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, ICO. |
| `dimPercent` | 0 (the default) for no dimming, or 1 to 99. |
| `bGrayScale` | `true` to turn the image grey. |
| `imageType` | `IMAGE_ICON` (the default) or `IMAGE_BITMAP`. |
| `clrBackground` | For `IMAGE_BITMAP`, the `ARGB` colour that translucent pixels are blended with; ignored for icons. |

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, which you must free with `DestroyIcon` or
`DeleteObject`; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hIcon as HICON = ImageFromFile( "save.png" )
dim hGrey as HBITMAP = ImageFromFile( "save.png", 40, true, IMAGE_BITMAP, ARGB_White )
DestroyIcon( hIcon ) : DeleteObject( hGrey )
```

Microsoft Learn: [Bitmap::GetHICON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-bitmap-gethicon)

### IconFromFile, BitmapFromFile

```freebasic
function IconFromFile( byref wszFileName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false ) as HANDLE
function BitmapFromFile( byref wszFileName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

[ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile) with `IMAGE_ICON` or with `IMAGE_BITMAP`.

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hIcon as HICON = IconFromFile( "open.png" )
dim hbm as HBITMAP = BitmapFromFile( "logo.png", 0, false, ARGB_White )
if hIcon = NULL then print "open.png could not be loaded"
```

### ImageFromFile2

```freebasic
function ImageFromFile2( byref wszFileName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval imageType as long = IMAGE_ICON, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

The same as [ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile), but the file is opened by GDI+'s own file loader
instead of being read into memory first. That loader shows images in dim grey (often used for
disabled icons) in darker shades, so prefer `ImageFromFile`. When the file cannot be opened the
call returns without shutting down the GDI+ start it made.

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hbm as HBITMAP = ImageFromFile2( "chart.png", 0, false, IMAGE_BITMAP )
DeleteObject( hbm )
```

Microsoft Learn: [Image::FromFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-fromfile)

### AddIconFromFile

```freebasic
function AddIconFromFile( byval hIml as HIMAGELIST, byref wszFileName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false ) as long
```

Loads an image file as an icon, with [ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile), adds it to the end of an
image list and destroys the icon.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hIml` | The image list. |
| `wszFileName` | The image file. |
| `dimPercent`, `bGrayScale` | As for [ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile). |

**Returns** the index of the new image. When the file cannot be loaded it returns **0**, the
same as the index of a first image: compare `ImageList_GetImageCount` before and after if you
need to tell.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hIml as HIMAGELIST = ImageList_Create( 24, 24, ILC_COLOR32 or ILC_MASK, 4, 4 )
AddIconFromFile( hIml, "new.png" )
AddIconFromFile( hIml, "new.png", 50, true )   ' the disabled look
```

### ImageFromBuffer

```freebasic
function ImageFromBuffer( byval pBuffer as any ptr, byval bufferSize as SIZE_T_, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval imageType as long = IMAGE_ICON, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

Converts an image file held in memory (the bytes of a PNG, JPEG, GIF … file) into a new GDI
icon or bitmap. The bytes are copied into a stream for GDI+, so the buffer can be freed as soon
as the call returns. `dimPercent`, `bGrayScale`, `imageType` and `clrBackground` work as for
[ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile).

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pBuffer` | The first byte of the image. |
| `bufferSize` | Its size in bytes. |

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hRes as HRSRC = FindResourceW( NULL, "LOGO", cast( LPCWSTR, RT_RCDATA ) )
dim pData as any ptr = LockResource( LoadResource( NULL, hRes ) )
dim hbm as HBITMAP = ImageFromBuffer( pData, SizeofResource( NULL, hRes ), 0, false, IMAGE_BITMAP )
```

### IconFromBuffer, BitmapFromBuffer

```freebasic
function IconFromBuffer( byval pBuffer as any ptr, byval bufferSize as SIZE_T_, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false ) as HANDLE
function BitmapFromBuffer( byval pBuffer as any ptr, byval bufferSize as SIZE_T_, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

[ImageFromBuffer](#imagefrombuffer) with `IMAGE_ICON` or with `IMAGE_BITMAP`.

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim pPng as ubyte ptr = callocate( 1 )   ' the bytes of a PNG file
dim hIcon as HICON = IconFromBuffer( pPng, 1 )
if hIcon = NULL then print "not an image"
deallocate( pPng )
```

### ImageFromRes

```freebasic
function ImageFromRes( byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszImageName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval imageType as long = IMAGE_ICON, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

Converts an image stored as a raw-data resource (`RCDATA`) into a new GDI icon or bitmap, as
[ImageFromBuffer](#imagefrombuffer) does with memory. `dimPercent`, `bGrayScale`, `imageType`
and `clrBackground` work as for [ImageFromFile](#imagefromfile).

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hInstance` | The module that holds the resource; `NULL` for the program itself. |
| `wszImageName` | The resource's name, or `"#"` and its number, such as `"#998"`. |

The resource must be embedded as `RCDATA`, for example `LOGO RCDATA "logo.png"` in the `.rc`
file; see [Resources](SysWin-Resources).

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hbm as HBITMAP = ImageFromRes( NULL, "LOGO", 0, false, IMAGE_BITMAP, ARGB_White )
dim hIcon as HICON = ImageFromRes( NULL, "#998" )
```

### IconFromRes, BitmapFromRes

```freebasic
function IconFromRes( byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszImageName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false ) as HANDLE
function BitmapFromRes( byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszImageName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false, byval clrBackground as ARGB = 0 ) as HANDLE
```

[ImageFromRes](#imagefromres) with `IMAGE_ICON` or with `IMAGE_BITMAP`.

**Returns** the new `HICON` or `HBITMAP`, yours to free; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hIcon as HICON = IconFromRes( GetModuleHandleW( NULL ), "TOOL_SAVE" )
dim hbm as HBITMAP = BitmapFromRes( NULL, "BANNER" )
```

### AddIconFromRes

```freebasic
function AddIconFromRes( byval hIml as HIMAGELIST, byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszImageName as wstring, byval dimPercent as long = 0, byval bGrayScale as long = false ) as long
```

Converts an `RCDATA` image resource into an icon, with [ImageFromRes](#imagefromres), adds it to
the end of an image list and destroys the icon.

**Returns** the index of the new image; **0** when the resource cannot be loaded, as for
[AddIconFromFile](#addiconfromfile).

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hIml as HIMAGELIST = ImageList_Create( 16, 16, ILC_COLOR32 or ILC_MASK, 4, 4 )
AddIconFromRes( hIml, NULL, "TOOL_OPEN" )
AddIconFromRes( hIml, NULL, "TOOL_SAVE" )
```

### ImageStreamFromRes

```freebasic
function ImageStreamFromRes( byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszImageName as wstring ) as IStream ptr
```

Copies an `RCDATA` resource into a block of global memory and returns a stream over it, ready for
the stream constructors of `CGpImage` and `CGpBitmap` (see [GDI+ images](SysWin-GdiPlus-Images)).
The stream owns the memory and frees it when it is released. The names work as for
[ImageFromRes](#imagefromres).

Each call starts GDI+ once and does not shut it down again.

**Returns** the stream, which you must release (`pStream->lpVtbl->Release( pStream )`) once the
image made from it has been destroyed; `NULL` on failure.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim pStream as IStream ptr = ImageStreamFromRes( NULL, "PHOTO" )
if pStream then
    scope
        dim img as CGpBitmap = CGpBitmap( pStream )
        print img.GetWidth()
    end scope
    pStream->lpVtbl->Release( pStream )
end if
```

### GetEncoderClsid

```freebasic
function GetEncoderClsid( byref wszMimeType as wstring ) as GUID
```

Returns the class id of the image encoder for a MIME type, which `CGpImage.Save` and
`GdipSaveImageToFile` need. The built-in encoders are `"image/bmp"`, `"image/jpeg"`,
`"image/gif"`, `"image/tiff"` and `"image/png"`; the case of the letters does not matter.

**Returns** the class id, or a GUID of zeros when no encoder handles the type.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim clsid as GUID = GetEncoderClsid( "image/png" )
dim wsz as wstring * 40
StringFromGUID2( @clsid, @wsz, 40 )   ' the PNG encoder's class id as text
```

Microsoft Learn: [Retrieving the class identifier for an encoder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-retrieving-the-class-identifier-for-an-encoder-use)

### SaveImageToFile

```freebasic
function SaveImageToFile( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring, byref wszMimeType as wstring ) as long
```

Saves a GDI+ image in the format of a MIME type (see [GetEncoderClsid](#getencoderclsid)), with
the encoder's default settings. An existing file is replaced. For a `CGpImage` or `CGpBitmap`
pass its `m_pImage` field.

A MIME type without an encoder fails (with `FileNotFound` (10)) and leaves an empty file behind.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pImage` | The GDI+ image. |
| `wszFileName` | The file to write. |
| `wszMimeType` | The format, such as `"image/png"`. |

**Returns** `Ok` on success, otherwise a GDI+ status; `InvalidParameter` when `pImage` is `NULL`
or the file name is blank. When GDI+ cannot be started it returns 0 without saving.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim bmp as CGpBitmap = CGpBitmap( 64, 64 )
if SaveImageToFile( bmp.m_pImage, "blank.png", "image/png" ) <> Ok then print "not saved"
```

Microsoft Learn: [Image::Save](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-save%28constwchar_constclsid_constencoderparameters%29)

### SaveImageToBmp, SaveImageToJpeg, SaveImageToJpg, SaveImageToPng, SaveImageToGif, SaveImageToTiff

```freebasic
function SaveImageToBmp( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
function SaveImageToJpeg overload( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
function SaveImageToJpg overload( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
function SaveImageToPng( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
function SaveImageToGif( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
function SaveImageToTiff( byval pImage as GpImage ptr, byref wszFileName as wstring ) as long
```

[SaveImageToFile](#saveimagetofile) with `"image/bmp"`, `"image/jpeg"` (both `Jpeg` and `Jpg`),
`"image/png"`, `"image/gif"` or `"image/tiff"`. JPEG is saved at the encoder's default quality;
GIF reduces the image to 256 colours.

**Returns** `Ok` on success, otherwise a GDI+ status.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim bmp as CGpBitmap = CGpBitmap( 64, 64 )
SaveImageToPng( bmp.m_pImage, "icon.png" )
SaveImageToJpg( bmp.m_pImage, "icon.jpg" )
```

### SaveHBITMAPToFile

```freebasic
function SaveHBITMAPToFile( byval hbmp as HBITMAP, byref wszFileName as wstring, byref wszMimeType as wstring = "image/bmp" ) as long
```

Saves a GDI bitmap, such as a screen capture, to a file in the format of a MIME type
(`"image/bmp"` by default; see [GetEncoderClsid](#getencoderclsid)). The bitmap is copied and
stays yours.

**Returns** `Ok` on success, otherwise a GDI+ status; `InvalidParameter` when `hbmp` is `NULL` or
the file name is blank.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hbm as HBITMAP = BitmapFromFile( "photo.jpg" )
SaveHBITMAPToFile( hbm, "photo.png", "image/png" )
DeleteObject( hbm )
```

Microsoft Learn: [Bitmap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-bitmap)

### PrintHBITMAP

```freebasic
function PrintHBITMAP( byval hbmp as HBITMAP, byval bStretch as boolean = false, byval nStretchMode as long = InterpolationModeHighQualityBicubic ) as boolean
```

Prints a GDI bitmap on the default printer, without a dialog, as a document named "Printing
bitmap", once per copy set in the printer's default settings.

- With `bStretch` `false` the bitmap is drawn at the top-left of the printable area at its own
  physical size (its resolution, 96 DPI for a screen bitmap).
- With `true` it is stretched to fill the whole printable area, resampled with
  `nStretchMode`; the proportions are not kept.

The printer's device context is not deleted afterwards.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hbmp` | The bitmap; it stays yours. |
| `bStretch` | `true` to fill the page. |
| `nStretchMode` | An `InterpolationMode*` value, used when stretching. |

**Returns** `true` when the document was sent to the printer; `false` when there is no default
printer or a step failed.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim hbm as HBITMAP = BitmapFromFile( "chart.png", 0, false, ARGB_White )
if PrintHBITMAP( hbm, true ) = false then print "not printed"
DeleteObject( hbm )
```

### LoadTexture

```freebasic
function LoadTexture overload( byref wszFileName as wstring, byref TextureWidth as long, byref TextureHeight as long, byref strTextureData as string ) as long
function LoadTexture overload( byval hInstance as HINSTANCE, byref wszResourceName as wstring, byref TextureWidth as long, byref TextureHeight as long, byref strTextureData as string ) as long
```

Loads an image from a file, or from an `RCDATA` resource, as texture data for OpenGL. The image
must be **square, with a side that is a power of 2** (64, 128, 256 …). It is flipped vertically,
because OpenGL starts at the bottom row, and its pixels are stored in `strTextureData` as 4
bytes each, red, green, blue, alpha: the layout `glTexImage2D` takes with `GL_RGBA` and
`GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE`. The string holds width × height × 4 bytes.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wszFileName` | The image file. |
| `hInstance`, `wszResourceName` | The module and the name of the resource. |
| `TextureWidth`, `TextureHeight` | Receive the size of the image. |
| `strTextureData` | Receives the pixels. |

**Returns** 0 on success; `ERROR_INVALID_DATA` (13) when the image is not square or its side is
not a power of 2 (the size is still filled in); a GDI+ status when the image cannot be loaded
(`OutOfMemory` (3) for a missing file); for the resource form, `E_POINTER` when the resource is
missing; 18 (`GdiplusNotInitialized`) when GDI+ cannot be started.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim as long w, h
dim texels as string
if LoadTexture( "brick.png", w, h, texels ) = 0 then
    ' glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, w, h, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, strptr( texels ) )
    print w; " x"; h; len( texels )   ' 64 x 64 16384 for a 64-pixel image
end if
```

### ObjectTypeIsValid

```freebasic
function ObjectTypeIsValid( byval type_ as ObjectType ) as boolean
```

Returns `true` when `type_` is one of the GDI+ object types of an EMF+ record, from
`ObjectTypeBrush` (1) to `ObjectTypeGraphics` (9).

**Example**

```freebasic
print ObjectTypeIsValid( ObjectTypeFont ); ObjectTypeIsValid( 99 )   ' truefalse
```

Microsoft Learn: [ObjectType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusenums/ne-gdiplusenums-objecttype)

## CGpBase

`CGpBase` is the base of every GDI+ class of the module. It holds the last status and keeps one
count, shared by all classes, of the live objects. You do not create one yourself; its members
are called on any `CGp*` object.

### Constructor, Destructor

```freebasic
constructor
destructor
```

The constructor adds one to the count of live GDI+ objects; when the count was 0 it starts GDI+
first. The destructor takes one off; when the count reaches 0 it shuts GDI+ down. If GDI+ cannot
be started, the constructor shows a message box saying so and stores the failure as the
object's status.

**Example**

```freebasic
scope
    dim pen as CGpPen = CGpPen( ARGB_Blue )   ' the first object: GDI+ starts
end scope                                     ' the last object: GDI+ stops
```

Microsoft Learn: [GdiplusStartup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusinit/nf-gdiplusinit-gdiplusstartup)

### GetLastStatus

```freebasic
function GetLastStatus() as GpStatus
```

Returns the status stored by the object's last call: the constructor's outcome until a method is
called, then the outcome of the last method that stores one. Unlike GDI+'s own `GetLastStatus`
it does not reset the value.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim fam as CGpFontFamily = CGpFontFamily( "NoSuchFont" )
if fam.GetLastStatus() <> Ok then print rtrim( StatusStr( fam.GetLastStatus() ) )   ' Font family not found
```

### SetStatus

```freebasic
function SetStatus( byval status as GpStatus ) as GpStatus
```

Stores `status` as the object's last status and returns it. The classes use it to record the
outcome of each call; call it yourself to clear the status before a sequence of calls.

**Returns** `status`.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim pen as CGpPen = CGpPen( ARGB_Red )
pen.SetStatus( Ok )
```

### RefCount

```freebasic
function RefCount( byval bIncrement as boolean ) as long
```

Adds one to the shared count of live GDI+ objects (`bIncrement` `true`) or takes one off
(`false`), starting GDI+ when the count was 0 and shutting it down when it reaches 0. The
constructor and destructor call it; call it yourself in matched pairs only, to keep GDI+ running
across a stretch of code without an object.

**Returns** the new count.

**Example**

```freebasic
dim pen as CGpPen = CGpPen( ARGB_Red )
pen.RefCount( true )      ' GDI+ now outlives the pen
pen.RefCount( false )
```

### Pixel formats

A `PixelFormat` value holds the bits per pixel in its second byte and flags in its upper bits.

| Constant | Value | Bits | Alpha | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PixelFormat1bppIndexed` | &h30101 | 1 | | indexed (palette) |
| `PixelFormat4bppIndexed` | &h30402 | 4 | | indexed |
| `PixelFormat8bppIndexed` | &h30803 | 8 | | indexed |
| `PixelFormat16bppGrayScale` | &h101004 | 16 | | extended |
| `PixelFormat16bppRGB555` | &h21005 | 16 | | |
| `PixelFormat16bppRGB565` | &h21006 | 16 | | |
| `PixelFormat16bppARGB1555` | &h61007 | 16 | yes | |
| `PixelFormat24bppRGB` | &h21808 | 24 | | |
| `PixelFormat32bppRGB` | &h22009 | 32 | | |
| `PixelFormat32bppARGB` | &h26200A | 32 | yes | canonical |
| `PixelFormat32bppPARGB` | &hE200B | 32 | yes | premultiplied alpha; the default of `CGpBitmap` |
| `PixelFormat48bppRGB` | &h10300C | 48 | | extended |

(&h40000), `PixelFormatPAlpha` (&h80000), `PixelFormatExtended` (&h100000) and
`PixelFormatCanonical` (&h200000); `PixelFormatUndefined` and `PixelFormatDontCare` are 0 and
`PixelFormatMax` is 15. Four macros test a format and one reads its size:

| Macro | Gives |
| --- | --- |
| `GetPixelFormatSize( pixfmt )` | the bits per pixel, as a `UINT` |
| `IsAlphaPixelFormat( pixfmt )` | 1 when the format has alpha, otherwise 0 |
| `IsIndexedPixelFormat( pixfmt )` | 1 when the format uses a palette |
| `IsCanonicalPixelFormat( pixfmt )` | 1 for the formats GDI+ works in natively |
| `IsExtendedPixelFormat( pixfmt )` | 1 for the formats with 16 bits per channel |

```freebasic
print GetPixelFormatSize( PixelFormat24bppRGB ); IsAlphaPixelFormat( PixelFormat32bppARGB )   ' 24 1
```

| `ImageFormatBMP`, `ImageFormatEMF`, `ImageFormatEXIF`, `ImageFormatGIF`, `ImageFormatIcon`, `ImageFormatJPEG`, `ImageFormatMemoryBMP`, `ImageFormatPNG`, `ImageFormatTIFF`, `ImageFormatUndefined`, `ImageFormatWMF` | `GUID` variables: the file format of an image, as `CGpImage.GetRawFormat` returns it. |
| `EncoderChrominanceTable`, `EncoderColorDepth`, `EncoderColorSpace`, `EncoderCompression`, `EncoderImageItems`, `EncoderLuminanceTable`, `EncoderQuality`, `EncoderRenderMethod`, `EncoderSaveAsCMYK`, `EncoderSaveFlag`, `EncoderScanMethod`, `EncoderTransformation`, `EncoderVersion` | `GUID` variables: the encoder settings an `EncoderParameter` can carry. |
| `FrameDimensionPage`, `FrameDimensionResolution`, `FrameDimensionTime` | `GUID` variables: the frame dimensions of multi-frame images (pages of a TIFF, frames of a GIF). |
| `BlurEffectGuid`, `SharpenEffectGuid`, `BrightnessContrastEffectGuid`, `HueSaturationLightnessEffectGuid`, `LevelsEffectGuid`, `TintEffectGuid`, `ColorBalanceEffectGuid`, `ColorCurveEffectGuid`, `ColorLUTEffectGuid`, `ColorMatrixEffectGuid`, `RedEyeCorrectionEffectGuid` | `GUID` variables: the GDI+ effects. `ColorBalanceEffectGuid` and `ColorCurveEffectGuid` do not match the GUIDs GDI+ knows, so creating those two effects from them fails with `Win32Error` (7). |
| `FlatnessDefault` | 0.25, the default flatness for flattening curves. |
| `GDIP_EMFPLUS_RECORD_BASE`, `GDIP_EMFPLUSFLAGS_DISPLAY` | &h4000 and 1, for EMF+ records. |
| `PropertyTag…` | The ids of image metadata items (`PropertyTagGpsLatitude`, `PropertyTagExifDTOrig` …), as `PROPID` values. |
