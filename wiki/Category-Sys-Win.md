# sys/win

> **In tiko.** Windows programming support written in tiko by José Roca: helpers over the Win32
> API, windows and dialogs, every common control, COM, rich edit, GDI+, Direct2D and WebView2.
> It ships with the toolchain as the `sys` package, source only: `#import "sys/win"` and nothing
> on the command line.

`sys/win` is **Windows-only**. Its modules build for `-target windows-x86_64`; importing one for
Linux or macOS stops with `sys/win is Windows-only` as the first error.

Each module also brings in the Windows headers it is built on, so the whole Win32 API (`HWND`,
`SendMessageW`, `WM_COMMAND`, `RECT` …) is there in any file that imports one.

## The modules

| Import | `using` name | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#import "sys/win"` | `win` | Helpers for windows, the display and DPI, fonts, the clipboard, bitmaps, paths, resources, common dialogs, the Internet and Unicode text |
| `#import "sys/win/gui"` | `gui` | `CWindow`, `CDialog` and the other window classes, and one namespace of functions per common control (`ListView`, `TreeView`, `Edit` …) |
| `#import "sys/win/com"` | `com` | `DVARIANT`, `DSafeArray`, `BSTRING`, `CDispInvoke` and COM helpers |
| `#import "sys/win/richedit"` | `richedit` | `CRichEditCtx`, the `RichEdit` functions and the Text Object Model classes |
| `#import "sys/win/gdiplus"` | `gdiplus` | The GDI+ classes: `CGpGraphics`, `CGpBitmap`, pens, brushes, paths, fonts, effects |
| `#import "sys/win/direct2d"` | `direct2d` | Direct2D factories, render targets, brushes and geometries, DirectWrite and WIC |
| `#import "sys/win/webview2"` | `webview2` | `CWebView2`, an Edge browser control in a window, and its event handlers |

The other modules import `sys/win` themselves; a program names each one it calls into.

## Importing

```freebasic
#import "sys/win"
#import "sys/win/gui"

using win, gui
```

`using` lets every name be written bare: `CenterWindow( hwnd )`. Without it, write the module
name first: `win.CenterWindow( hwnd )`. The control functions of `sys/win/gui` live in one
namespace per control and are always written with it, `ListView.AddColumn`, `Edit.GetText`,
after `using gui` as before.

## Things to know

**Wide strings.** Parameters that take text are `wstring ptr` or `byref wstring`: pass a literal,
a `ustring` or a `wstring` buffer. Functions that return text return a `ustring`.

**The W forms of Win32.** The Windows headers come in without `UNICODE`, so a bare Win32 name
such as `DrawText` or `SendMessage` is the ANSI (`A`) function and `LOGFONT` is the ANSI
structure. Either call the `W` names (`DrawTextW`, `SendMessageW`, `LOGFONTW`), as every page of
this category does, or build with `-d UNICODE`, or set it in your `tiko.toml` (a file cannot
`#define UNICODE` ahead of `#import "sys/win"`):

```toml
[target.main.defines]
UNICODE = "1"
```

The functions of `sys/win` itself are Unicode whichever you choose.

**One name, two meanings.** Where a helper has the name of a Win32 function, both are there and
the arguments pick: `GetWindowText( hwnd )` returns a `ustring`, while the Windows form still
takes a buffer and a length. A narrow literal passed to `SetWindowText` goes to the Unicode
helper, read as UTF-8.

**Rectangles as tuples.** Functions that measure a rectangle return the four edges as a tuple:
`var (l, t, r, b) = GetWindowRect( hwnd )`.

**Colours.** `RGB_*` (a `COLORREF` for GDI, red in the low byte) and `ARGB_*` (an opaque GDI+
colour) constants come with `sys/win/gui` and `sys/win/gdiplus`; see [Colours](SysWin-Colors).

**Examples.** Every function has a short example. The examples assume `hwnd` is your window,
`hDlg` a dialog and `hCtrl` a control; a page's full program at the top is complete and builds as
it stands with `tiko file.tiko`. More programs, from a button in a window to a WebView2
browser, are in the toolchain's `examples/win64/` folder.
