# Text

The functions to search, slice, change, split and format strings, grouped by what you want to do. The **From** column says what a program needs before it can call one:

- **built-in**: nothing; it is always available.
- `std/money`: `#import "std/money"`, then `using money` to call it by its bare name.
- `std/strings`: `#import "std/strings"`, then `using strings` to call it by its bare name.
- `string.bi`: `#include "string.bi"`.
