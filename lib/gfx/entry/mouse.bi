'' entry/mouse.bi -- GETMOUSE and SETMOUSE, routed to the window.
''
'' ORIGINAL WORK. Part of libtkogfx: LGPL-2.1-or-later with the static-linking
'' exception.
''
'' THESE ARE HOOKS, NOT ENTRY POINTS, and the difference matters for the symbol
'' table. `getmouse x, y` compiles to fb_GetMouse, which is the RUNTIME's, and
'' that consults __fb_ctx.hooks.getmouseproc. So nothing here needs an fb_Gfx*
'' name and nothing here is exported: the table carries the addresses.
''
'' INSTALL BOTH OR NEITHER. fbc's own rtlib has a copy-paste defect in
'' hook_setmouse.c -- fb_SetMouse tests GETMOUSEPROC and then calls
'' SETMOUSEPROC -- so a table with getmouse set and setmouse null calls a null
'' pointer there. tiko-rt tests the right slot (src/io/hookcon.bas), but this
'' library has to be linkable against both, and installing the pair costs
'' nothing.
''
'' The state machine, the coordinate rules and the failure convention are
'' driver/mouse.bi's and core/events.bi's, and tools/abtest-mouse.bas compares
'' them against gfxlib2 by moving the real pointer. What is new here is only the
'' seam: that the statements reach them.
