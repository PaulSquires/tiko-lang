'' DRAW STRING [target,] (x,y), text [, colour [, font [, mode ]]]
''
'' (target, x, y, flags, text, colour, font, mode, blender, customproc,
''  customparam)
''
'' Flags are convention B. The return is int64 on win64 and int32 on win32; it
'' is the error number, and 0 here.
''
'' TWO MEASURED TRAPS, both of which make a correct-looking implementation wrong:
''
''   THE DEFAULT MODE IS 0 (TRANS), not PUT's XOR. Same numbering, different
''   default, and taking PUT's default here makes every string invert.
''
''   `ALPHA, n` OVERWRITES THE COLOUR ARGUMENT with the alpha value, silently
''   discarding a colour that was written. So in mode 9 the colour slot is not a
''   colour -- reading it as one draws in whatever the alpha happened to be.
''
'' NOT IMPLEMENTED, and each is a real gap rather than a default:
''
''   A CUSTOM FONT IMAGE. `font` is an image whose glyphs replace the built-in
''   set; only the built-in 8x8/8x14/8x16 fonts are drawn. A caller passing one
''   gets the built-in font rather than an error, which is the wrong picture --
''   but refusing would break the common case of passing nothing.
''   The blender slot is filled only when a custom font is supplied, so it is
''   unreachable for the same reason.
''
''   THE BLEND MODES. Every mode draws the glyph transparently in its
''   foreground colour; the bitwise and alpha blenders are not applied.
''   raster/text.bi draws glyph-by-glyph rather than through a putter, so
''   routing them needs the glyph rendered to a scratch surface first -- which
''   is work, not a line. PSET and TRANS are correct today because neither
''   paints the clear pixels; the rest are approximated by TRANS.
