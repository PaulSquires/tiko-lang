'' entry/access.bi -- SCREENLOCK, SCREENUNLOCK, SCREENSYNC.
''
'' Derived from: gfx_access.c (fb_GfxLock, fb_GfxUnlock), gfx_vsync.c
'' (fb_GfxWaitVSync), win32/gfx_win32.c (fb_hWin32WaitVSync).
'' LGPL-2.1-or-later with the static-linking exception.
''
'' SCREENPTR is the third of gfx_access.c's routines and lives in entry/screen.bi
'' beside the screen it points into.
''
'' THE LOCK IS THE WINDOW'S FRAME LOCK. The presenter thread holds it for every
'' present and every message dispatch (driver/window.bi, note 4), so while a
'' program holds SCREENLOCK the window neither repaints nor delivers input --
'' which is gfxlib2's behaviour and the reason SCREENLOCK exists: nothing is
'' shown half-drawn. A loop that waits for a key INSIDE a lock therefore waits
'' forever, in both libraries.
''
'' NESTED LOCKS COUNT; only the first takes the lock and only the last releases
'' it, exactly as gfxlib2 calls driver->lock() and unlock() at lock_count 0.
''
'' SCREENUNLOCK MARKS THE ROWS IT WAS GIVEN, and only when the work page is the
'' one on show: that is how rows written through SCREENPTR -- which no drawing
'' primitive marked -- reach the window. A negative start means 0, a negative
'' end means the last row, and an end past the last row marks NOTHING (the C's
'' `end_line < h` test), rather than being clamped.
