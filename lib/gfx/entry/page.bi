'' entry/page.bi -- SCREENSET, FLIP / SCREENCOPY / PCOPY.
''
'' Derived from: gfx_page.c (fb_GfxPageSet, fb_GfxFlip, fb_GfxPageCopy).
'' LGPL-2.1-or-later with the static-linking exception.
''
'' The pages themselves are entry/context.bi's ScreenState. These two move the
'' work and visible pages and copy one page onto another; the console hooks in
'' entry/console.bi point at the same two functions, which is how PCOPY and
'' SCREEN's QB page arguments reach them.
''
'' FOUR RULES FROM THE C, EACH OF WHICH A NATURAL GUESS GETS WRONG:
''
'' 1. PAGESET RETURNS THE PAGES AS THEY WERE, work in the low byte and visible in
''    the second -- and -1, not 0, with no screen open.
'' 2. A PAGE OUT OF RANGE IS IGNORED, NOT AN ERROR. SCREENSET 5, 0 on a two-page
''    screen changes the visible page and leaves the work page alone. Both
''    arguments negative means "0, 0", which is what a bare SCREENSET does.
'' 3. FLIP COPIES ONLY THE VIEW. The pixel copy is clipped to the current VIEW
''    rectangle; the character cells are copied whole. Out-of-range pages ARE an
''    error here, unlike PAGESET.
'' 4. FLIP MARKS THE COPY DIRTY ONLY WHEN IT TOOK THE LOCK ITSELF -- when the
''    destination is the visible page and no SCREENLOCK is held. Under a
''    SCREENLOCK the rows are not marked, and the copy is presented only when
''    something else marks them. Reproduced, not fixed.
