'' entry/info.bi -- SCREENINFO, IMAGEINFO, IMAGECONVERTROW.
''
'' Derived from: gfx_screeninfo.c (fb_GfxScreenInfo32/64),
'' gfx_image_info.c (fb_GfxImageInfo32/64), gfx_image_convert.c
'' (fb_GfxImageConvertRow), win32/gfx_win32.c (fb_hScreenInfo).
'' LGPL-2.1-or-later with the static-linking exception.
''
'' EACH OF THE FIRST TWO IS A PAIR, split on the width of its outputs: `long`
'' arguments reach the 32 form and `integer` ones the 64 form. Both are here
'' because tiko's prelude overloads on exactly that, and a program that passes
'' INTEGERs would otherwise have its 8-byte slots half written.
''
'' SCREENINFO WITH NO SCREEN OPEN DESCRIBES THE DESKTOP -- its width, height,
'' depth and refresh rate, in physical pixels -- with bpp and pitch 0 and an
'' empty driver name. With one open it describes the screen, and the refresh
'' rate is still the desktop's: gfxlib2's windowed drivers never set their own.
''
'' THE DRIVER NAME IS "GDI", which is what presents the frame here. gfxlib2 on
'' the same machine answers "Direct2D", the driver it picked; a program that
'' compares the name against a driver it asked for with SCREENCONTROL
'' SET_DRIVER_NAME gets the truthful answer rather than an echo.

'' the write only when that answers non-zero. A TEMPORARY descriptor -- what fbc
'' passes for an omitted `driver` argument -- is released and NOT written, since
'' nothing would ever read it. Anything else is assigned through the runtime,
'' which owns the string's memory.
