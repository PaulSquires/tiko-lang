#
# THREE TARGETS: windows-x86_64, linux-x86_64 and macos-arm64 (docs/graphics
# RFC-0012, phase P1). Any host builds any of them -- the library is one `tiko -c`
# per target, and nothing here needs the target's SDK -- and with no target named
# the host's own is built. driver/window.ti picks the platform: the Win32 window on
# Windows, and on Linux and macOS, until their drivers land (X11 L1, Cocoa M1),
# driver/nodisplay: GFX_NULL and FBGFX=null screens work and a windowed SCREEN
# answers an error, as gfxlib2 does when no driver loads.
#
# windows-x86_64 IS THE MICROSOFT ABI (TARGET_WINDOWS_X86_64, added 2026-09-05), and
# there is no MSVC libfbgfx anywhere to fall back to: fbc's is MinGW, so it cannot go
# into an MSVC binary at all.
#
# THE LIBRARY IS HEADER-ONLY, so this is ONE translation unit. Every .ti under
# abi/, core/, driver/, raster/ and entry/ is included by src/all.tiko, and every
# routine below entry/ is `private`. That is deliberate -- RFC-0001 makes the
# entry-point layer the only public surface.
#
# THE COMPILER IS TIKO (bootstrap plan, phase G, 2026-10-10): the tree's bin/tiko, or
# TKOGFX_TIKO, which targets windows-x86_64 itself -- one step, no clang retarget. Measured
# when it changed: the same 368 functions and the same 83 public symbols as fbc's build.
# An fbc builds it only as the ORACLE, when TKO_ORACLE_FBC names one -- to tell a
# library difference from a compiler difference; nothing shipped is built that way. That
# fbc must understand -z msvc (fbc-modern's working tree, 2026-09-05 or later): without it
# fbc emits the gnu triple and builds the wrong ABI without saying so, so that path
# refuses rather than falls back. The oracle builds windows-x86_64 only.
