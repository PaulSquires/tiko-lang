#   build/symbols.sh [target ...]
#
# For every symbol tiko-rt defines, assert that fbc's own archive defines a
# symbol with the BYTE-IDENTICAL name, on every target.
#
# This is the check that catches the whole class of win32 decoration mistakes,
# and it is worth having as a script rather than as an occasional look, because
# the failure is invisible until link time and then total:
#
#   FBCALL entry points     _fb_WstrCompare@8   -- stdcall, @N = argument bytes
#   non-FBCALL internals    _fb_hListInit       -- cdecl, no suffix
#
# Getting the @N wrong by four bytes produces a symbol that does not resolve; and
# omitting it produces one that resolves against nothing, silently, until a
# program calls it.
#
# win64 and linux-x86_64 have no decoration at all, so **they cannot catch any of
# this** -- which is the point of running it on all three.
