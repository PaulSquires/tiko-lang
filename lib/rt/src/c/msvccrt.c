/* msvccrt.c -- the CRT startup and the few shims ucrtbase.dll does not export.
**
** MSVC-ONLY, and empty everywhere else: the gnu targets get all of this from
** fbc's crt2.o and libmingwex.a, which are on their link line already.
**
** WHY THIS EXISTS.  Before it, a win64-msvc link needed Visual Studio on the
** machine doing the compiling -- not the SDK, VC Tools specifically, for
** libcmt.lib, libvcruntime.lib, oldnames.lib and legacy_stdio_definitions.lib.
** Measured 2026-09-06: those four are the only reason clang reached into
** "C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio". They are also NOT in Microsoft's
** own redistributable set -- VC/Redist/MSVC/<v>/x64 contains runtime DLLs and no
** static libraries at all -- so shipping copies was not obviously permitted.
**
** WHAT WAS ACTUALLY MISSING was small, and that is the point of the file.
** ucrtbase.dll is a Windows system component present on every Windows 10 and
** later, and it exports 2,650 symbols: every mem* and str* function, fileno,
** the whole stdio core, and every startup primitive used below. A link against
** it plus our own import libraries left exactly six names undefined:
**
**     mainCRTStartup   the entry point, which lives in no DLL
**     _fltused         a marker the backend emits a reference to
**     atexit           over _crt_atexit, which IS exported
**     sprintf          inline in the UCRT headers, so not exported
**     time localtime   named _time64 and _localtime64 in the UCRT
**     feraiseexcept    inline in the UCRT's fenv.h (added later; see below)
**
** floor and floorf were on that list too and are not shim work: they were a bug
** in our generated ucrtbase.lib, which marked them as DATA imports.
**
** NOT A TRANSLITERATION OF MSVC's STARTUP.  Every entry point called here is
** exported by ucrtbase.dll and declared below from its documented signature.
** The one thing that had to be read rather than guessed is what sprintf passes
** to __stdio_common_vsprintf, because getting the option word wrong is a silent
** formatting difference rather than a link error. From the SDK's own stdio.h:
** sprintf calls _vsprintf_l, which calls _vsnprintf_l with a count of
** (size_t)-1, which calls __stdio_common_vsprintf with
** _CRT_INTERNAL_LOCAL_PRINTF_OPTIONS | _CRT_INTERNAL_PRINTF_LEGACY_VSPRINTF_NULL_TERMINATION
** and returns -1 for any negative result. _CRT_INTERNAL_LOCAL_PRINTF_OPTIONS is
** (*__local_stdio_printf_options()), a per-translation-unit static that is zero
** unless the unit sets it, so the whole word here is the one legacy flag.

** fegetround, feholdexcept, fesetenv, fesetexceptflag, fesetround and fetestexcept, and
** not this one -- checked against the DLL, not the import library. fb/fenv.bi's
** RaiseFpException calls it, so math/fenv linked under fbc (libmingwex has it) and not
** here.
**
** EXACTLY THE FLAGS ASKED FOR, through the exported fesetexceptflag. Raising them by
** arithmetic, as the UCRT's inline version does, is measurably not what fbc's program
** gets: an overflowing multiply sets INEXACT with OVERFLOW, and so does an underflow,
** where libmingwex's feraiseexcept sets the one bit it was given -- raising OVERFLOW
** under fbc tests true for OVERFLOW alone. The bits are the UCRT's own _SW_* codes;
** fb/fenv.bi detects that family at startup and translates to it.
**
** fexcept_t CARRIES EACH FLAG TWICE, and that is measured, not read: fegetexceptflag
** after '1 / 0' stores &h08000008 -- the _SW_ bit for the x87 status word in the low
** byte and again at bit 24 for MXCSR. Handed the bare &h08, fesetexceptflag returns 1
** and sets nothing; handed both halves it sets exactly that flag, all five tested. */

** names are real symbols in libmingwex; under the MSVC ABI they are COMPILER
** intrinsics, expanded inline by the C frontend and present in no library at all -- so
** an FB program that reaches one gets 'lld-link: error: undefined symbol:
** _InterlockedExchangeAdd', which is 24 of the corpus link failures build/linkscan.sh
** reports, every file that uses fb/comptr.bi.
**
** __atomic_fetch_add WITH SEQ_CST, which is what the Windows contract says: the
** Interlocked family is a full barrier in both directions, and __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST is the
** only ordering that promises that. The return value is the OLD value, which is what
** both the intrinsic and the FB declaration expect.
**
** Named without the leading underscore in the generated call is NOT a possibility: the
** header declares the underscored spelling and that is the symbol the linker asks for.
*/
