'' ports.bas -- fb_hIn and fb_hOut, the INP and OUT statements' back end. Two
'' symbols, one fbc member (win32/sys_portio.o on win64, unix/sys_portio.o on
'' linux-x86_64).
''
'' LINUX SINCE 2026-09-19 (decision 0015, D15). Until then this file was empty
'' there and fbc's own member came from lib/linux-x86_64-fb/. The permission
'' check is here; the two instructions are src/c/portinsn.c -- the measurement
'' below, that -gen llvm cannot emit them, still stands.
''
'' NAMED ports.bas RATHER THAN portio.bas ON PURPOSE. The build flattens
'' src/sys/portio.bas to sys_portio.o, which is fbc's OWN member name, and
'' gate.sh merges by deleting fbc members that collide. On win32 and linux this
'' file is EMPTY -- so the merge would have deleted fbc's real sys_portio.o and
'' put an empty object in its place, silently removing fb_hIn and fb_hOut from
'' the archive on the two targets that still need fbc's versions. build.sh
'' refuses the collision by name; the rename is the fix.
''
'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'' WIN32 AND LINUX CANNOT BE DONE, AND THIS TIME THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN
'' INHERITED FROM A TABLE.
''
'' The hinit.o batch found the "stays in C" classification wrong because the
'' inline asm it cited was behind a #if arm that no target in R3 compiles. That
'' made every remaining Class A entry worth re-checking rather than trusting.
'' sys_portio.o was re-checked the same way, and it comes out the OTHER way:
''
''   win32   HOST_X86 is defined, so fb_hIn/fb_hOut really do contain
''             __asm__ volatile ("inb %1, %0" : "=a" (value) : "d" (port))
''           and the outb counterpart. The shipped object proves the arm is live
''           -- it carries the whole driver-installation machinery
''           (OpenSCManager, CreateService, DeviceIoControl, the 5,632-byte
''           fbportio.sys blob as `fbportio_driver`), which only exists inside
''           that same #ifdef.
''   linux   `#if defined HOST_X86 || defined HOST_X86_64` -- x86-64 satisfies
''           the second half, so the asm is live there too.
''   win64   HOST_X86 is NOT defined, so the member falls through to the #else
''           arm: two one-line stubs that report ILLEGALFUNCTIONCALL. The object
''           confirms it -- fb_hIn is 0x20 bytes and the ONLY thing it imports
''           is fb_ErrorSetNum. No driver, no service handles, no blob.
''
'' AND -gen llvm REALLY DOES REJECT INLINE ASM. Probed rather than assumed,
'' because the whole point of re-checking is not to trade one inherited belief
'' for another:
''
''     asmprobe.bas(9) error 374: Inline ASM is not supported by -gen llvm;
''     compile this module with -gen gas64 or -gen gcc
''
'' There is no API alternative to the instruction, either. The driver does not
'' PERFORM the I/O -- IOCTL_GRANT_IOPM edits the process's I/O permission bitmap
'' so that a user-mode `inb` stops faulting. The instruction is the mechanism,
'' not an optimisation of one.
''
'' So win32 keeps three symbols in C (fb_hIn, fb_hOut, fbportio_driver) and
'' linux keeps two. That is the correct answer for those targets, and it is
'' recorded here so the next re-check reads the measurement instead of repeating
'' it.
''
'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'' THE win64 STUBS ARE NOT A DEGRADED PORT -- they are what fbc ships. INP and
'' OUT are unavailable in every 64-bit Windows build of FreeBASIC, and the
'' program is told so through the normal error path rather than by a crash.
''
'' THE SIGNS DIFFER, DELIBERATELY. fb_hIn NEGATES the error number and fb_hOut
'' does not. fb_hIn's return value is the BYTE READ, so it has no spare
'' encoding for failure -- a negative result is the out-of-band signal, and 0..255
'' stays a valid reading. fb_hOut has nothing to return but a status, so the
'' error number is the result. Copying one line to the other would give INP a
'' plausible reading of 1 on a machine that cannot do port I/O at all.
''
'' NEITHER IS FBCALL. fb_system.h declares both plainly, and fbc's own win32
'' object names them `_fb_hIn` / `_fb_hOut` -- the C leading underscore with no
'' @N suffix, which is what settles it.
