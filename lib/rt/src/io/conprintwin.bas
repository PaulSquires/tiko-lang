'' conprintwin.bas -- the WINDOWS fb_ConsolePrintBuffer and
'' fb_ConsolePrintBufferEx, the bottom of every PRINT on Windows. Two symbols,
'' one fbc member (win32/io_printbuff.o).
''
'' EMPTY-ON: linux-x86_64
''
'' THE POSIX HALF IS src/io/conprint.bas AND SHARES NOTHING WITH THIS. The two
'' are separate files rather than two arms of one #if because they are separate
'' programs: POSIX writes bytes to stdout and keeps its own shadow of the
'' screen, Windows writes CHAR_INFO cells into a console screen buffer that the
'' OS owns and asks the OS where the cursor is. 40 lines against 250.
''
'' THERE ARE THREE OUTPUT PATHS AND THEY ARE TRIED IN THIS ORDER:
''
''   1  REDIRECTED -- an empty console window rect means stdout is a pipe or a
''      file. Raw WriteFile, no cells, no cursor. This is what makes `PRINT`
''      work in a pipe.
''   2  UTF-16 STREAM -- decode the bytes with the console's OWN output
''      codepage and hand the result to WriteConsoleW. This is the only path
''      that can render a multi-byte sequence as the character the console
''      would show, because the cell path spends one cell per BYTE. It is also
''      the only path that gets double-width glyphs right.
''   3  CELLS -- WriteConsoleOutput, one CHAR_INFO per byte, with fbc doing its
''      own wrapping, scrolling and cursor arithmetic through fb_ConPrintTTY
''      and the two hooks below.
''
'' PATH 2 REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. fb_hConsoleStreamOutW (in
'' src/io/conprintw.bas) returns FALSE when VIEW PRINT is active or the window
'' is narrower than the screen buffer, because in both cases the console would
'' wrap and scroll somewhere fbc does not want it to. Path 3 then runs and the
'' bytes stay exact. MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS is asked for ONLY under CP 65001 --
'' a single-byte codepage maps all 256 values, so demanding validity there
'' would reject nothing and cost a flag.
''
'' scrollWasOff IS A DEFERRED SCROLL, and it is the subtlest thing here. A write
'' that ends exactly at the last column has filled the line but must NOT scroll
'' yet, because the next thing might be a LOCATE. So the scroll is remembered in
'' __fb_con.scrollWasOff and the cursor is parked at the last cell; the NEXT
'' print performs it. Getting this wrong does not crash -- it prints a blank
'' line at the wrong moment, which is exactly the kind of defect a suite that
'' compares output catches and one that compares return values does not.
''
'' alloca IS REPLACED BY malloc/free. The freestanding subset has no alloca and
'' -gen llvm will not take inline asm; the write hook allocates and frees per
'' call instead. That is a real cost on the hot path and it is stated here
'' rather than hidden: the cell path is already one WriteConsoleOutput syscall
'' per run of text, so a malloc beside it is not what decides the speed. THE
'' FAILURE MODE DIFFERS THOUGH -- alloca cannot fail and malloc can, so the hook
'' returns 0 (write failed) where fbc would have carried on.
''
'' AND THE HIGH BYTE OF CHAR_INFO.Char DIFFERS. fbc writes only AsciiChar into
'' an alloca'd, uninitialised buffer, so the other byte of the union is stack
'' residue; this writes the whole 16-bit union with the byte in the low half and
'' zero above. WriteConsoleOutputA reads AsciiChar alone, so the difference is
'' not observable -- but it is a difference, and the reason it is safe is worth
'' recording rather than rediscovering.
