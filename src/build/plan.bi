'' plan.bi -- from a subcommand's arguments and tiko.toml to the classic command lines that
'' build each target (tiko-build RFC-0001 §5; PLAN B2).
''
'' A TARGET is a [target.<name>] of the nearest tiko.toml at or above the current directory,
'' or the IMPLICIT target: the roots on the command line (RFC B4). A PROFILE is a set of
'' compiler flags: 'debug' and 'release' are built in, a manifest's [profile.<name>] overrides
'' one key by key or declares another, and 'inherits' starts from a parent's. Manifest targets
'' build under 'debug' unless '--profile' says otherwise (B10); the implicit target takes a
'' profile only when one is asked for, so 'tiko build a.tiko' stays 'tiko a.tiko'.
