'' build.bi -- 'tiko build' and the other subcommands (tiko-build RFC-0001; PLAN B1).
''
'' A SUBCOMMAND IS THE FIRST ARGUMENT, and only one of five exact words: build, run, check,
'' clean, metadata (RFC §4.1). Anything else is the classic fbc-style driver, unchanged --
'' 'tiko a.bas b.bas' never comes here. fbc refuses an extensionless input outright (error
'' 81, probed 2026-10-11), so reserving the words costs no compatibility; a source file
'' that really is called 'build' is written './build'.
''
'' B1: 'build' and 'clean' of the IMPLICIT target -- the roots on the command line, the
'' first one owning main, the output beside it or at '-o' (RFC B4). One in-process
'' Driver.Run, so a build makes the same objects and the same link a classic run does,
'' plus the lock (TKO0166), the JSON event stream and one diagnostics file. 'run', 'check'
'' and 'metadata' are reserved and answer TKO0992 until their phases (B2, B5).
