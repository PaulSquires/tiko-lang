'' binresult.bas -- THE RESULT TYPE OF A BINARY OPERATOR.
''
'' One table, measured against fbc operator by operator: concatenation, the string and
'' pointer rules, the comparison tiers and the numeric promotions.
''
'' Split out of check.bas at the 1500-line cap and included from it in the same place.
'' Nothing in it changed in the move.

'' '=' AND '<>' BETWEEN TWO OF ONE TUPLE TYPE ARE AN INTEGER -- fbc-modern 1.20 says
'' 'typeof( a = b )' is INTEGER, and prints -1 or 0. They had NO type here: a tuple is
'' no builtin, so the table below never answered, and an untyped comparison lowered only
'' where nothing asks its type -- 'if a = b' and 'r = ( a = b )'. 'print a = b', 'str( a
'' = b )', '-( a = b )' and '( a = b ) + 1' were each left out of the program in silence.
'' The same test as the one that accepts the comparison (proccheck.bas, CheckUdtCompare_).
