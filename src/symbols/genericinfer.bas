'' genericinfer.bas -- INFERRING A TYPE ARGUMENT FROM A CALL'S OWN ARGUMENTS.
''
'' Split out of generic.bas at the 1500-line cap and included from it in the same
'' place. Nothing in it changed in the move.

'' THE TYPE OF ONE ARGUMENT, well enough to infer a type parameter from it -- which is
'' much less than typing an expression. Check does that, and Check has not run.
''
'' A NAME and a LITERAL are the two shapes worth knowing, because they are the two the
'' runtime headers pass: 'Some( r )' over a local, and 'Some( 3 )' over a literal. A
'' REFERENCE is transparent -- 'byval v as T' called with a byref parameter binds T to
'' the referent, not to a reference. Anything else returns TYPE_NONE, and the call then
'' declines rather than instantiating at a guessed type.
'' THE PROCEDURE-POINTER TYPE OF A NAME, built from the procedure's own
'' declaration. Check has a routine for this and it is in another namespace with
'' another Ctx; this one resolves the typerefs itself, which is what Resolve is
'' for and what makes it usable BEFORE Check has typed anything.
''
'' AN OVERLOADED NAME IS REFUSED. Choosing between overloads is overload
'' resolution, which runs later and with the parameter type in hand; picking one
'' here would be a guess, and a wrong instantiation is worse than none.
'' Declared ahead of its definition: generic.bas includes this file BEFORE
'' TypeMemberNamed_ is written, and the N_INDEX arm below needs it.
