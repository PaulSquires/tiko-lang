'' Split out of check.bas when that file passed the 1500-line lint cap. The subject is
'' one question asked several ways: which procedure a call means, which operator an
'' expression means, and whether an argument is viable for a parameter at all.
''
'' #included from check.bas rather than compiled separately: it reads that file's Ctx
'' and calls TypeOf_, so it has to sit after both.

'' Could this expression have an ADDRESS? Asked by the byref-exactness rule, because
'' that rule exists only where there IS a variable to write back through: fbc converts
'' a constant into a temporary and takes any type at all. Answered from the SHAPE,
'' since Check has no source manager to fold constants with.
'' ONE PARAMETER'S TYPE, off a procedure symbol. The same walk the lowering's
'' ParamTypeAt does; Check needs it to look at a constructor it did not itself call.

'' WHAT A USER-DEFINED CONVERSION COSTS, or CONV_NONE when there is none.
''
'' ConversionCost knows the standard conversions and nothing else -- it takes only a
'' TypeContext, so it cannot look a constructor or a cast operator up. Two shapes were
'' therefore not viable for ANY overload:
''
''     sub f( byval x as UDT ) ... f( 1122 )        a CONVERSION CONSTRUCTOR on UDT
''     function h( byval i as integer ) ... h( q )  an 'operator cast' on q's type
''
'' Neither was a diagnostic. The call simply bound to nothing, came out untyped, and
'' whatever consumed it declined -- and where the callee bound anyway, because there was
'' only one candidate, the raw operand went to it: an integer where an object belongs.
''
'' PRICED ABOVE EVERY STANDARD CONVERSION AND BELOW CONV_NONE, and ADDED to the cost of
'' the standard conversion that follows it, because that one still ranks: measured,
'' offered 'h( integer )' and 'h( double )' against a UDT casting to integer, fbc picks
'' the DOUBLE overload. Saturating instead would have made the two tie.
