'' collect.bas -- declaration collection.
''
'' The first of the three name-resolution sub-phases (docs/plan/07 section 1). It
'' walks the AST and creates a symbol for every declaration, wiring up scopes. It
'' does NOT resolve types or look inside procedure bodies for references: that is
'' Resolve's job, and keeping the two apart is what gives FreeBASIC's
'' order-independence for free.
''
'' Contract:
''   - May report "duplicate declaration".
''   - May NOT report undefined symbols, type errors, or anything needing a lookup of
''     something that might be declared later.
