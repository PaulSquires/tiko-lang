'' token.bi -- the token model.
''
'' A Token is 16 bytes and carries no payload of its own beyond a handle: identifiers
'' hold an InternId, literals hold an index into the unit's literal pool. The original
'' spelling is always recoverable from (loc, length) against the source buffer, so
'' nothing needs to be copied to preserve it (docs/plan/03 section 4).
''
'' Invariants:
''   - Every token has a valid loc within its file, including TK_EOF.
''   - TK_IDENT's ident is the interned ASCII-FOLDED spelling. Case-sensitive text
''     comes from the source buffer, never from the interner.
''   - The vector always ends with exactly one TK_EOF.
''   - A malformed token is TK_INVALID with a real span. The lexer never stops early.
