'' lowerdesc.bas -- the array descriptor, synthesised for a FIXED array, and ERASE.
''
'' See docs/internals/phase-6-array-descriptor.md for the measurements this implements.
'' The short version:
''
''     ptr   DATA          off 0    biased base: PTR - (lowest index tuple) * elemLen
''     ptr   PTR           off 8    the real base
''     ssize SIZE          off 16   total bytes
''     ssize ELEMENT_LEN   off 24
''     ssize DIMENSIONS    off 32
''     ssize FLAGS         off 40
''     DIMTB[n]            off 48   { ELEMENTS, LBOUND, UBOUND } each, dim 0 first
''
'' with every offset halved on win32. Total = 6*ptr + dims*3*ptr.
''
'' A FIXED array has no descriptor in memory: fbc synthesises one on the stack at the
'' array's DECLARATION point and passes that. tiko-lang synthesises it at the point of USE
'' instead. That is a deliberate difference, and it is safe because the descriptor is
'' pure function of compile-time constants -- the bounds, the element size, and the
'' array's own address -- none of which can change between the two points.
