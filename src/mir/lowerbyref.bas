'' lowerbyref.bas -- the temporaries a BYREF argument needs when the value it binds
'' has no address of its own.
''
'' Split out of lowercall.bas at the 1500-line cap and INCLUDED from it, inside the
'' same namespace. Nothing moved here changed in the move.


'' A temporary holding an argument that must be passed BYREF and has no address of its
'' own. Returns the temporary's ADDRESS, or nothing when the value would not lower or
'' the parameter's type is one a scalar slot cannot hold.
''
'' AN AGGREGATE GOES THE SAME WAY, and it has to: 'sub tester( byref x as UDT =
'' type<UDT>( 123 ) )' called as 'tester( )' is 329 statements in one corpus file
'' alone. A UDT rvalue lowers to a LOADED aggregate -- a value, not an address -- so
'' passing it where a pointer belongs was the same bug in a wider slot. The store is
'' the plain M_STORE of an aggregate that a UDT return already uses.
'' NOT PRIVATE ANY MORE: 'operator []( index as integer )' declares a BYREF parameter --
'' in the fb dialect a parameter is byref unless it says otherwise -- so 'x[ 0 ]' needs
'' the same temporary an ordinary call's byref argument does. See LowerUdtIndexOp_.
'' A CONSTRUCTOR'S BYREF PARAMETER GIVEN AN RVALUE, which has no address to take.
''
'' CtorArgValue_'s reference arm tries LowerAddr and, when that answers nothing, used to
'' fall through to the value path -- its comment said so deliberately. It cannot: the
'' parameter is a REFERENCE, so the value goes out where a pointer belongs.

'' THE REFERENT'S TYPE, NOT THE REFERENCE'S. PushCtorArgs_ wraps a byref parameter in a

''
'' THIS COPIES, which fbc does not: it passes the original temporary's address. The
'' copy is observable only to a callee that compares addresses or counts destructions,
'' and structs/temp-var-dtors.bas counts destructions -- so runscan against fbc is what
'' says whether this is right, not the fact that it compiles.
'' A BYVAL NON-TRIVIAL UDT ARGUMENT TAKES A POINTER TO A COPY, because that is what
'' its parameter's SLOT holds -- see ParamMirType. Both default-filling loops passed
'' the loaded aggregate instead and the callee read an address out of the object's own
'' bytes; clang refused the module first: "'%t5' defined with type '[4 x i8]' but
'' expected 'ptr'" on 'constructor( byval v as D2 = D2( 9 ) )' with D2 declaring a
'' destructor. A DEFAULT is a fresh rvalue, so the value IS the copy and only needs a
'' home, which is all ByrefAggTempOf_ gives it.
''
'' NOT MATCHED AGAINST fbc, because fbc does not lower this shape at all: it writes
'' 'struct $2D2 TMP$3$0;' and calls the constructor with its address WITHOUT running
'' D2's constructor on it, so the callee reads an uninitialised temporary and the
'' program prints 0 where the default says 9. The alternative here was not fbc's
'' answer but IR that does not assemble.
