# bootstrap.sh -- the self-hosting fixpoint: tiko-lang compiles itself, twice.
#
#   build/bootstrap.sh [-O<n>] [--target <name>] [--stage1 <tiko>] [--seed <tiko>] [--gate]
#
# docs/plan/13 section 8 and D11, as one command. The Windows peer is
# build/bootstrap.bat and is kept line-for-line analogous.
#
#   stage0  the seed builds tiko-lang                          -> stage1
#   stage1  compiles tiko-lang's own sources                   -> stage2
#   stage2  compiles them again                                -> stage3
#
# and asserts, in this order:
#
#   1. stage1 LOWERS EVERY STATEMENT of every module, and every module verifies. A
#      build reports no decline, so a statement tiko gives up on vanishes from the
#      compiler it is building and nothing says so. That is not hypothetical:
#      'Tko.TKO_VERSION_SUFFIX' in cmdline.bas declined twice, and the self-built
#      compiler's --version lost its suffix and its whole target line.
#   2. stage2 AND stage3 ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL FILES. Nothing is zeroed and nothing is
#      masked: the link is reproducible (HANDOFF 8m). stage1 == stage2 too, below:
#      the seed builds stage1 with stage2's own command.
#   3. stage3 COMPILES A PROGRAM AND IT PRINTS WHAT THE SEED'S BUILD OF IT PRINTS.
#   4. With --gate, THE SUITE AGAINST stage2 FAILS EXACTLY WHAT IT FAILS AGAINST
#      stage1. A fixpoint says the compiler reproduces itself; it says nothing about
#      code tiko-lang's own source never exercises. The suite does: a paren-less
#      'cast( ulong, flds.Count )' passed byref gave every threadcall descriptor a
#      CODE ADDRESS for its field count, in stage2 and stage3 alike, and only the
#      suite run against stage2 could see it. "The same failures" rather than "none",
#      because a worktree has an environmental one or two (see HANDOFF).
#
# -O<n> is passed to the stage1 and stage2 compiles of tiko-lang; Phase 10's
# criterion is the fixpoint at -O0 AND -O2. --stage1 skips the stage0 build and
# uses the given compiler. --target defaults to the host's default target.
#
# Headers: the tree's own inc/ (phase H), else the seed's, or TKO_BOOT_INC. Libraries: per target below, or TKO_BOOT_LIBDIRS (space-separated).
# TKO_LIBPATH and TKO_INCLUDE from the caller are NOT inherited: a variable exported
# for some earlier probe would otherwise decide what this links (see Learnings).
#
# Everything lands in build/.bootstrap/, which is cleared first: a stage binary
# left by an earlier run would compare equal to itself and prove nothing.
#
# STAGE0 IS A SEED: '--seed <tiko>' (or TKO_SEED), else build/defaultseed.sh's pick --
# a packaged tiko, where FBC-Modern was until 2026-10-10; nothing here runs or reads fbc.
# (Diverse double-compiling, which does build with fbc, is the bootstrap plan's
# scripts/ddc.sh, through build.sh's TKO_ORACLE_FBC.) The seed builds stage1 with EXACTLY
# the command stage1 builds stage2 with, so a fifth assertion holds and is checked:
# stage1 == stage2 -- a correct tiko of commit X reproduces X's compiler on its first
# step (measured, tiko-bootstrap VERIFICATION.md). Headers and libraries default to
# the seed's own inc/ and lib/<target>/, and hello's reference output is the seed's.
