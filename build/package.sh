# run, which a release archive puts beside the compiler in tiko-lang/ (build/release.sh).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- what it is NOT
#
# THIS DOES NOT PRODUCE A SELF-CONTAINED TOOLCHAIN, and the manifest it writes says
# so. One thing stays external, and one is optional:
#
#   clang    src/codegen/toolchain.tiko runs clang for BOTH steps -- the .ll to .o
#            compile and the link. It is found at C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin, or
#            wherever TIKO_CLANG points. Bundling LLVM is a gigabyte and a separate
#            decision, so a packaged toolchain depends on an installed one.
#
#   win64    -target win64, the MinGW ABI, is NOT PACKAGED (the author's order,
#            2026-10-10; decision Q2): no lib/win64, no MinGW runtime. The compiler
#            still accepts the target -- build tiko-rt for it (lib/rt/build/build.sh
#            Release win64) and link with a MinGW-w64 on PATH. windows-x86_64, the
#            default, and linux-x86_64 need nothing of the kind.
#
# Neither is a packaging bug. Both are written into MANIFEST.txt so that a
# toolchain cannot be passed on with them invisible.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------- NO fbc
#
# Since 2026-10-10 nothing here reads fbc or fbc-modern. The compiler is built by the
# pinned seed (seed/seed.lock), the runtime and the graphics library by that compiler,
# the headers are the tree's inc/, the import libraries lib/implib/, and FreeBASIC's
# notices licences/. The third-party bindings come from the seed's inc/ -- tiko's own
# last release -- until the author decides where they live.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------- cross-packaging
#
# A host packages ITSELF. build/build.sh compiles the compiler for the machine it
# runs on, so tiko-linux comes from running this under Linux or WSL and
# tiko-windows from running it on Windows. There is no --host flag: it would only
# ever produce a tree with a foreign binary in it.

# architecture -- -m32 is now an error and TargetFromName knows no "win32" -- so
# lib/rt/build/common.sh dropped it from RT_TARGETS, and the guard below then
# died with "no runtime for win32" on every single run. Nothing could be
# packaged on Windows at all, which is also why no libtkogfx ever reached a
# toolchain: the script never got as far as copying one.
#
# WINDOWS-X86_64 IS THE DEFAULT and is listed first. It is the only target lib/gfx
# builds, so it is the only one where a SCREEN program links; and it is the ONE
# target that needs nothing behind it. That is measured, 2026-09-06: a program
# built for windows-x86_64 against lib/windows-x86_64 alone -- no fbc directory, none to
# have -- linked and ran. tiko-rt's MSVC archive carries no MinGW imports
# (build/abidelta.sh, and gatemsvc.sh at 3,922,073 assertions). win64 needed fbc's
# libfb behind it until decision 0015 (D15); now it needs only fbc's CRT behind it.

#
# TKEDIT SHIPS WITH THE TOOLCHAIN (the author's orders, 2026-10-27 and 2026-10-29): a release
# archive unpacks to ONE folder, tiko-lang/, with tkedit in its root (tkedit.exe next to
# tiko.exe, tkedit or tkEdit.app in the root above bin/tiko), and tkedit finds the compiler in its
# own folder or its bin/ (tkedit/src/core/build: SiblingCompiler). Here every host packages into one
# toolchains/, so the editor is staged apart, as tkedit-<host>; build/release.sh puts it in.
#
# ONE FILE (docs/tkEdit/SINGLE-FILE.md): tkedit links in SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, scintk and its
# scanner, and carries its fonts, themes, catalogs, keyword lists and licences inside itself
# ('tkedit --export-resources DIR' writes them out, '--licences' prints the notices). So the folder
# holds tkedit.exe / tkedit alone, and on macOS tkEdit.app: Contents/MacOS/tkedit, Info.plist and
# Resources/tkEdit.icns (the .icns made from icons/tkedit.png with sips + iconutil), signed ad hoc
# (SINGLE-FILE SF3, SF5).
#
# BUILT BY THE TOOLCHAIN JUST PACKAGED, so this is one more check that it works. A failure
# is recorded as FAIL rather than ending the run: the toolchain itself is good, and
# build/release.sh refuses a MANIFEST with a FAIL in it.
