# stdsuite.sh -- RUN the standard library's own tests, and hold them to a baseline.
#
# 108 files of fbc's corpus (tests/vendor/fbc-tests) test the libraries pkg/std is made of:
# containers, strings, chrono, tasks, outcome, numeric, money, logs, tui and COM. They were
# written against the headers -- '#include "fb/string.bi"', 'using FB' -- and tests/vendor is
# never edited, so when the headers became modules each file was COPIED to tests/std and
# rewritten there to '#import' (build/stdtests.py). This script runs either set:
#
#   build/stdsuite.sh --baseline [PAT]   the vendored originals, over the headers; writes
#                                        tests/std/baseline/<area>/<name>.txt
#   build/stdsuite.sh [PAT]              the ports in tests/std, each compared with its
#                                        baseline; exit 1 on any difference
#
# PAT is a substring of the path ('string/', 'container-map'). One record per file:
#
#   build=<rc> run=<rc>        and the program's output, normalised
#
# by the corpus's own TEST_MODE: an fbcunit SUITE links with fbcunit's driver and prints its
# table; COMPILE_AND_RUN_OK / _FAIL build alone and run; COMPILE_ONLY_FAIL only builds, and
# its record is the build's exit code and the diagnostic IDS (not their text: a port may
# spell a type 'containers.Array' where the header spelled 'FB.Array'). A '_mod2.bas' beside
# a suite is the second module it is linked with.
#
# Every run is from a COPY of the test's directory (data files; and these suites write), with
# a closed stdin and a timeout. Modules are cached in a private TIKO_MODCACHE, emptied first.
